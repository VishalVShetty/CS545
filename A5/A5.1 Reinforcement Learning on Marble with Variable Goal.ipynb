For each goal, start the marble at positions 0 through 10 with zero velocity and the specified goal and applies the trained agent to control the marble for 200 steps.  Calculate the distance of the final state from the goal.  Average this distance over all starting positions for the specified goal and store in a numpy array with one row for each goal and each row containing the goal and the average of distances to goal over all starting positions. Call this numpy array, `distances_to_goal`.  Plot the results of these average distances versus the goal.\n",

Try just three or four different values for each parameter, varying one parameter value at a time. After you have found some parameter values that often work well, set the parameters to these values and run again to produce the graphs from `plot_status` showing the results with these parameters. But, first <font color='red'>modify `plot_status` code</font> for subplots 6 and 9 so that the vertical pink goal region correctly shows the current goal.
